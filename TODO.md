# Suggested Steps for Task Completion

0. Get understanding the user task by analyzing it!

1. search_code: search relevant files in case <environment_details> includes a large number of files. If this fails, use other alternatives to get overview. Note that If the number of files in <environment_details> is low (probably below 10), do not execute search_code.

2. read_file: read potential files to the query.

3. brainstorm_plan: after understading the files, get the comprehensive plan. This is must-have step!
